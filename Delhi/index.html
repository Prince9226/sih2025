            <h3>India Gate</h3>
            <p>India Gate is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath, on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of
              New Delhi, formerly called Kingsway. It stands as a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army
              who died in the period 1914–1921 in the First World War.</p>
            <p>The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it
              was designed by Edwin Lutyens. The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then
              Viceroy, Lord Irwin.</p>
            <p>Another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti, was added much later after India got its independence. The eternal
              flame burns day and night under the arch to remind the nation of soldiers who laid down their lives in the
              Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971.</p>

            <h3>Red Fort</h3>
            <p>The Red Fort is a historical fortification in the old Delhi area. It was the main residence of the
              emperors of the Mughal dynasty for nearly 200 years, until 1857. It is located in the center of Delhi and
              houses a number of museums.</p>
            <p>Constructed in 1639 by the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as the palace of his fortified capital
              Shahjahanabad, the Red Fort is named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone. The fort's
              architectural style is a mix of Islamic, Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions.</p>
            <p>The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex. Every
              year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian flag at the main gate
              of the fort and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.</p>

            <h3>Qutub Minar</h3>
            <p>Qutub Minar is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms part of the Qutb complex, a UNESCO World Heritage
              Site in the Mehrauli area of Delhi, India. The height of Qutub Minar is 72.5 meters, making it the tallest
              brick minaret in the world.</p>
            <p>Qutub Minar was begun after the defeat of Delhi's last Hindu kingdom by the Muslim invader Qutb-ud-din
              Aibak in 1192. It was completed by his successor Iltutmish. The minaret is made of fluted red sandstone
              covered with intricate carvings and verses from the Quran.</p>
            <p>The complex also contains the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, which was built at the same time as the minaret,
              and the much older Iron Pillar of Delhi, which dates back to the 4th century AD. The pillar is famous for
              its rust-resistant composition of metals.</p>

              nine sides, with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 34 meters and a
              capacity of 2,500 people.</p>
            <p>The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and has been featured in many newspaper and
              magazine articles. Since its inauguration, it has attracted over 100 million visitors, making it one of

            <h3>Jama Masjid</h3>
            <p>The Masjid-i Jahān-Numā, commonly known as the Jama Masjid of Delhi, is one of the largest mosques in
              India. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1644 and 1656 at a cost of one million
              rupees, and was inaugurated by an imam from Bukhara, present-day Uzbekistan.</p>
            <p>The mosque has three great gates, four towers and two 40 m high minarets constructed of strips of red
              sandstone and white marble. The courtyard can accommodate more than 25,000 persons. The mosque houses
              several relics in a closet in the north gate, including a copy of the Qur'an written on deer skin.</p>
            <p>The architectural plan of Badshahi Masjid, built by Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb at Lahore, Pakistan, is
              similar to the Jama Masjid. The Jama Masjid is also the final architectural extravagance of Shah Jahan
              with a perfect balance between architecture and aesthetics.</p>
